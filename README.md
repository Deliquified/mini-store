### Flow Description

1. **User Interface Layer**
   - App discovery through categories and search
   - Installation/uninstallation interface
   - App management dashboard

2. **Data Layer**
   - Local app registry (demo phase)
   - IPFS storage for metadata
   - Universal Profile LSP28TheGrid data

3. **Process Flow**
   - User selects app to install/uninstall
   - System prepares LSP28TheGrid metadata
   - Metadata is uploaded to IPFS
   - IPFS hash is retrieved
   - Final LSP28TheGrid data is prepared and encoded
   - Universal Profile is updated with new grid data

4. **Integration Points**
   - Universal Profile Provider for blockchain interaction
   - IPFS (Pinata) for decentralized storage
   - Local registry for app metadata (to be decentralized in future)
